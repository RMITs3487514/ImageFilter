Bugs with the Firefox version (v 57):
-No CSS in popup
-No CSS in options menu
-Debug display: images with long URLs fill up a good chunk of the screen. Compare this to the Chrome extension, which has these long URLs go off the screen instead 
-Some sites are affected by the filter while others are not. There are differences between Firefox and Chrome.
-Shift-clicking too many times on an image results in it disappearing from the page. Shift-click enough times and the entire screen can become blank.
-Minimum/maximum size filter doesn't work?
